Bratrack UDP Receiver Class:

BraTrackUDP.cpp
BraTrackUDP.h

Examples:
udpBratrack_receiver.c: output the Bratrack's raw data received via UDP protocol
To build this example just copy the Makefile_udpBratrack to Makefile
"cp Makefile_udpBratrack Makefile"

BratrackTest.cpp: map the position and rotation of artifacts into 3D opengl environment.
To build this example just copy the Makefile_BratrackOpenGL to Makefile
"cp Makefile_BratrackOpenGL Makefile"

udp-recv.c: same as udpBratrack_receiver.c but doesn't uses the BraTrackUDP class.
